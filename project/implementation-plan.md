### Missing Dependencies

The following dependencies from the Technology Stack are **not yet installed**:

- ❌ **Zod** - Required for validation schemas (FR-031)

### Installed but Unused

- ⚠️ `react-hook-form` - Installed, not yet used

---

**Technology Stack:**

- React 19+ with Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode, no `any`)
- React Flow for canvas rendering
- Zod for validation
- ShadCN UI for components
- TailwindCSS for styling

**Architecture Principles:**

- Feature-based folder structure with single `workflow` feature
- Canvas as independent, reusable component (not tied to workflow)
- Separation of concerns (components → UI, hooks → state, services → I/O)
- Dependency injection for testability
- Discriminated unions for state modeling (`type` + `name` pattern)
- Result types over exceptions
- Derived state over stored state (e.g., node configured status derived from `name`)

**Project Structure (emerges organically as features are built):**

```
src/
  app/                    # Next.js App Router
  components/
    ui/                   # ShadCN components
    canvas/               # React Flow abstraction (created in Phase 2)
  features/
    workflow/             # Workflow feature (created in Phase 3+)
      components/         # Workflow-specific components
      hooks/              # Workflow hooks
      types/              # Domain types
      constants/          # Node catalog, layout constants
      utils/              # Utility functions
      schemas/            # Zod validation schemas
  lib/                    # Shared utilities (cn helper, etc.)
```

> **Note:** Directories are created as needed when implementing features, not upfront.

### Task 3.1: Define Core Domain Types ✅

- [x] Create `src/features/workflow/types/workflow.ts`
- [x] Define `NodeType` for structural role:
  ```typescript
  type NodeType = 'trigger' | 'action' | 'plus' | 'placeholder';
  ```
- [x] Define `NodeName` for concrete implementations:
  ```typescript
  type TriggerName = 'schedule';
  type ActionName = 'send-email' | 'if-else';
  type NodeName = TriggerName | ActionName;
  ```
- [x] Node status is derived from `name`:
  - `name: null` → unconfigured
  - `name: NodeName` → configured (or partially configured if config incomplete)
- [x] Add JSDoc documentation for all types

**Acceptance Criteria:**

  ```typescript
  interface TriggerNode {
    id: string;
    type: 'trigger';
    name: TriggerName | null;

    name: ActionName | null;
    position: { x: number; y: number };
    branchId?: string;
    config?: SendEmailConfig | IfElseConfig;
  }
  ```
- [x] Define `PlusNode`:
  ```typescript
  interface PlusNode {
    id: string;
    type: 'plus';
    position: { x: number; y: number };

    forType: 'trigger' | 'action';
    position: { x: number; y: number };
    branchId?: string;
  }
  ```

### Dependencies Between Phases

- Phase 2 requires Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 requires Phase 2 completion
- Phase 4 requires Phase 3 completion
- Phases 5-8 can proceed in parallel after Phase 4
- Phase 9 can proceed after Phase 5
- Phase 10 can proceed after Phase 5
- Phase 11 requires all previous phases

### Risk Mitigation

- Start with simplest implementations, iterate
- Test frequently during development
- Keep React Flow abstracted to allow replacement
- Use feature flags for incomplete features if needed

### Future Considerations (Out of Scope)

- Workflow persistence (save/load)
- Workflow execution engine
- Additional node types
- User authentication
- Undo/redo functionality
- Workflow templates
